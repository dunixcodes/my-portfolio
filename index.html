      About Me
    </h2>
  </section>

  <section class="section section--alignCentered section--description">
    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      Hello, thank you for visiting my website. Yes -- my name is Unix,
      though I was not really named after the operating system.
    </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      I have always been fascinated with computers and technology but it never
      entered my mind to pursue a career in information technology. It was not 
      until I worked as an IT asset manager that I started to seriously consider 
      the idea. I was working side-by-side with IT folks and it really motivated 
      me because I understood the work they were doing and I picked up on concepts 
      pretty quickly.
    </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      I started applying for IT jobs and it was difficult to be taken seriously since
      I did not have a formal education or experience. I mostly learned either by
      looking things up on the internet, taking courses online, or from experimenting
      on my personal computer that I built from scratch. I was adviced to take
      the CompTIA Security+ by one of the recruiters and so I dedicated 2 months
      to study for the certification. I got it on the first try and I was ecstatic!
    </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      That was my start in IT and now that I have gained more experience, I realized
      that the cloud is the next big thing in the industry. I decided to create
      this portfolio to gain practical skills in cloud technologies and showcase what
      I have learned so far.
    </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      I am familiar with basic programming concepts such as OOP, and algorithmic
      design from learning Python.
    </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      Other than working on my portfolio, I am also currently pursuing my
      Bachelor's degree in Software development and Security. </p>

    <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
      I hope to be part of a DevSecOpsnteam where I can use my broad knowledge 
      of system administration, information security, cloud technologies, and 
      software development to find efficient solutions
      for today's problems.
    </p>

          Using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, I created a simple website for my projects.
